Tic Tac Toe Road Map

Gather Requirements
  1. We'll need to setup a clickable board
  2. We need a section for Player 1 and Player 2 to input their names.
  3. Have the game randomly assign who goes first
  4. We need the game to alternate turns between both players
  5. Need to disallow both players from playing on the same space twice.
  6. Be told when a move causes a player to win.
  7. Start the game over without having to reset the browser
    
    If the User wants to play against a computer
    1. have the Computer make 'better-than-guessing' choices when placing a mark on the board
    2. set the board size myself ("wider" or "taller" than 3x3)

Plan out how to approach the project
  1. Setup a Board with buttons
  2. Setup two inputs that take in the players name and assigns that player either X or O.
  3. Setup and keep track of players turns and what symbols they are using.
  4. Only allow for each cell to be entered one time.
  5. Set the terms for a win and display a message if the game was won by one of the players
  6. Else, the game ends in a draw when all cells are occupied.
  7. Have a play again button reset the board.
    If the User wants to play against a computer
    1. Setup the computer to be a player based on a button "Play against computer"
    2. Setup a function that allows for the first move to be random and then attempts to play in a spot that is next to the cell it started on and so on.
